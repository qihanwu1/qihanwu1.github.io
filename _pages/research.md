# Object representation and perception

I study the principles that guide object representation and perception, and extend those principles to structures that are not conventional objects but governed by similar principles. 

## Orbit-Centered Representation (OCR)

I use multiple-object tracking (MOT) as a paradigm to investigate what kind of representation is used during different motion types. The OCR hypothesis predicts that rotating objects are represented in a compositional way, which is different from other types of motion (i.e., translation). 

# Representation format and computations

Humans flexibly use different formats to represent incoming information. When the way information is represented matches task-specific procedural demands, performance is typically better. However, when there is a mismatch between the representation and the task, performance tends to suffer. I use the multiple object tracking (MOT) paradigm to provide evidence for this claim. 

## When the representation format and task-specific procedural demands are in conflict

### Visual Illusions

#### Motion Silencing Illusion

I designed and created various visual illusions. I think visual illusions can tell us a lot about how humans see the world and how their mind works. Visual illusions are also fun and cool to look at. See some of the visual illusions I created in 'Demo'. One visual illusion that I mostly work on is called motion silencing. My work shows that motion silencing is not caused by things moving too fast, rather it is an attribution error (i.e., difficulties in attributing dot's color to dot's location).

# Beauty Perception

I am interested in the perception of beauty. 

## The dimensionality of beauty

One fundamental question about perception is how many numbers (or dimensions) are needed to fully describe it. For example, color is three-dimensional, area is two-dimensional, and length is one-dimensional. How many numbers are needed to describe beauty?

### Object representation and perception

Objects are believed to play a privileged role in visual processing not only because the world is composed of objects but also because we often perceive elements that do not qualify as conventional objects through principles of object-centered representation, i.e., perceptual grouping and Gestalt principles. I proposed that the principles of object-centered representation might extend even further, applying to structures emerging from motion. These structures are object-like in nature and establish their own internal reference frames. Components that form part of these structures are represented not only in external coordinates like the screen, but also within these internal frames of reference. The representations in different reference frames are linked by rules simliar to perceiving an object in a scene. This extension of the concept is particularly significant because it involves the representation of properties that are not present in the low-level stimulus like axes and relational variables. By expanding the scope of object-centered representation, my work underscores how the visual system integrates dynamic and relational properties into its perceptual framework.

This paper is about the number 1. The number 2 is left for future work.
