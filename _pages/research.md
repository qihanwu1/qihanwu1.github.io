### Object representation and perception

Objects are believed to play a privileged role in visual processing not only because the world is composed of objects but also because we often perceive elements that do not qualify as conventional objects through principles of object-centered representation, i.e., perceptual grouping and Gestalt principles. I proposed that the principles of object-centered representation might extend even further, applying to structures emerging from motion. These structures are object-like in nature and establish their own internal reference frames. Components that form part of these structures are represented not only in external coordinates like the screen, but also within these internal frames of reference. The representations in different reference frames are linked by rules simliar to perceiving an object in a scene. This extension of the concept is particularly significant because it involves the representation of properties that are not present in the low-level stimulus like axes and relational variables. By expanding the scope of object-centered representation, my work underscores how the visual system integrates dynamic and relational properties into its perceptual framework.

This paper is about the number 1. The number 2 is left for future work.
