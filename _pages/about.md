Hi! I am Qihan and like to study how we represent and process dynamic visual information. I obtained my Ph.D. from [Johns Hopkins University](https://pbs.jhu.edu), under the supervision of [Jonathan Flombaum](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-flombaum/). 

I am a cognitive scientist specializing in human visual cognition. I primarily use psychophysics and computational methods to quantify human responses to moving stimuli. By jointly designing tasks and measurement tools, I uncover patterns of perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral errors to understand why people fail at specific tasks or scenarios and how to avoid that.
